Simple Unity library for setting up code delays, and making code run for a certain amount of time.
Do you feel like you over-use coroutines/IEnumerators? Then this is for you!

Hihgly optimized for memory and performance. Uses pooling for each delay, and nothing runs if it doesn't need to.
Delays persist between scenes if told to, with a simple variable in the function call!

Please read the UsageExample.cs script!
